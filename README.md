## General info
This is an old project from Campbell University. It is a website about DC Comics. This is the first website that I created.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* PHP

## Features
* It shows a gallery of some of the most popular heroes from DC Comics
* Offers links to DC Comics website to learn more about their amazing heroes
* Shows a table of when specific Comic Con events happened in 2015!

## Setup
It is recommended to create a localserver on a terminal window (e.g. command line) to see everything in the home.html file.
First you must be in the directory with all the home.html files and all the other files and images that accompany it 
and then enter this command in the terminal if you have Python 3:

```
$ python -m http.server 3000
```

Or this command if you have Python 2:

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Once this is done, you can then enter http://localhost:3000/ in a web browser.

## Sources
This website was inspired by sketch.com and by DC Comics. The pictures are from google 
images. Special thanks to my professor, Mark Merry, for teaching me how to bring this
website to life.
